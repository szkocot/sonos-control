# Sonos MCP — available tool snapshot

Source: tool metadata exposed in the development session on 2026-09-10. These are call declarations and descriptions supplied by the environment, not a raw JSON Schema export. Current tool schemas in a new session take precedence. No player identifiers or credentials are included.

## mcp__sonos__add_players_to_group

Add players to a Sonos group. The added players adopt the group's current audio (replacing whatever they were previously playing). Use this for requests like 'add the bedroom to the group' or 'also play in the kitchen'. Also use this before starting multi-player playback ('play X in both the kitchen and bedroom') — group the players first, then call a play_* tool on the combined group so all players play in sync. All players must belong to the same household as the group. IMPORTANT: After this call, always call get_households_and_groups_and_players once before continuing — group IDs and memberships from earlier in the conversation may be invalid (groups can be created, disbanded, or recomposed; player IDs stay stable). Don't reason about what changed; use the fresh state.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__add_players_to_group(args: {
  // The Sonos group gaining the players
  group_id: string;
  // The players to add to the group
  player_ids: Array<string>;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__adjust_group_volume

Turn a Sonos group's volume up or down by the specified amount. Adjusts all players in the group proportionally, preserving their relative balance — it does not apply the same delta to every player. If the group is muted (all its players muted), adjusting the group volume also unmutes it. Group volume and player volume are linked — changing one affects the other. To turn a single player up or down, use adjust_player_volume; to apply an identical delta to every player, call it on each player individually instead.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__adjust_group_volume(args: {
  // The Sonos group ID
  group_id: string;
  // Amount to adjust volume
  volume_delta: number;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__adjust_player_volume

Turn a Sonos player's volume up or down by the specified amount. Adjusting a player's volume does not change its mute state. Group volume and player volume are linked — changing one affects the other. To turn a whole group up or down proportionally, use adjust_group_volume instead.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__adjust_player_volume(args: {
  // The Sonos player ID
  player_id: string;
  // Amount to adjust volume
  volume_delta: number;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__get_group_volume

Get the volume and mute state of a Sonos group. Group volume is the average level across the group's players. Group volume and player volume are linked — changing one affects the other. To get the volume of a single player, use get_player_volume instead.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__get_group_volume(args: {
  // The Sonos group ID
  group_id: string;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__get_households_and_groups_and_players

Get the household, group, and player IDs every other Sonos tool needs — a discovery of the user's whole Sonos system(s): every household, its groups (each with current playback state), and their players (speakers) with capabilities. Call it the first time you need any ID, and again after any grouping change (add_players_to_group, remove_players_from_group, move_audio_to_players), since group IDs and memberships go stale. Otherwise reuse that result for the rest of the conversation — no need to call it again before every operation. Only a call made in the current conversation is authoritative — never rely on names or IDs from any other source (your memory, past conversations, or general knowledge of the setup), because the system can change anytime (players renamed, groups reorganized, added, or removed).

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__get_households_and_groups_and_players(args: { [key: string]: unknown; }): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__get_night_sound_and_speech_enhancement

Get the Night Sound and Speech Enhancement settings for a Sonos player. Speech Enhancement improves TV dialogue and voice clarity; Night Sound reduces loud effects for late-night listening. Only supported on players with home theater playback (soundbars) — check that `HT_PLAYBACK` is in their capabilities from get_households_and_groups_and_players. Returns nightSound and speechEnhancement as booleans.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__get_night_sound_and_speech_enhancement(args: {
  // The Sonos player ID
  player_id: string;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__get_now_playing

Return what's currently playing on a Sonos group: the source (playlist, station, album, or radio, with its name and type); the current song or track's name, artist, album, and duration — or, for radio and other streams, the station or stream info; and the next track when available. Playback advances continuously — call this every time the user asks what's playing, even if you called it earlier in the conversation.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__get_now_playing(args: {
  // The Sonos group ID
  group_id: string;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__get_player_volume

Get the volume and mute state of a Sonos player. Group volume and player volume are linked — changing one affects the other. To get the volume of a whole group, use get_group_volume instead.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__get_player_volume(args: {
  // The Sonos player ID
  player_id: string;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__get_registered_music_services

List the music services the user has set up for a Sonos household. Call this only to answer informational queries like 'what music services are set up on Sonos?' The accountLabel is a user-defined label for disambiguating multiple accounts of the same service; it defaults to the account name but can be any string.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__get_registered_music_services(args: {
  // The Sonos household ID
  household_id: string;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__get_shuffle_repeat_crossfade

Get the shuffle, repeat, and crossfade settings for a Sonos group. Returns shuffle, repeat, repeatOne, and crossfade as booleans.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__get_shuffle_repeat_crossfade(args: {
  // The Sonos group ID
  group_id: string;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__get_sonos_favorites

Get all Sonos favorites saved to a Sonos household. These are items saved within the Sonos app and are distinct from favorites or saved content on any music service. Returns each favorite's name and ID. Use this when the user asks what Sonos favorites are available, or to look up a favorite ID before playing one. Favorites marked `unavailable: true` can't be played — likely the associated music service account is missing.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__get_sonos_favorites(args: {
  // The Sonos household ID
  household_id: string;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__get_sonos_playlists

Get all Sonos playlists saved to a Sonos household. These are playlists created in or imported into the Sonos app and are distinct from playlists on any music service. Returns each playlist's name, ID, and track count. Use this when the user asks what Sonos playlists are available, or to look up a playlist ID before playing one.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__get_sonos_playlists(args: {
  // The Sonos household ID
  household_id: string;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__move_audio_to_players

Move the audio currently playing on a Sonos group to a new set of players, atomically and with no audio gap. Players in the source group not listed in destination_player_ids stop playing (their previous audio does not resume); players in destination_player_ids that weren't in the source group adopt the moved audio. Use this for requests like 'move the music from the kitchen to the bedroom', 'switch playback to the kitchen instead', or 'play in the bedroom only'. To simply add players to a group, use add_players_to_group; to simply remove, use remove_players_from_group. All players must belong to the same household as the group. IMPORTANT: After this call, always call get_households_and_groups_and_players once before continuing — group IDs and memberships from earlier in the conversation may be invalid (groups can be created, disbanded, or recomposed; player IDs stay stable). Don't reason about what changed; use the fresh state.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__move_audio_to_players(args: {
  // The players that will be playing the audio after the move
  destination_player_ids: Array<string>;
  // The Sonos group whose audio is being moved
  source_group_id: string;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__pause

Pause playback on a Sonos group — stop the music where it is (it can be resumed). This is the plain 'pause'/'stop' action. IMPORTANT: Stateless command — always execute when asked, without first checking or assuming whether music is playing or paused.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__pause(args: {
  // The Sonos group ID
  group_id: string;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__play_album

Play an album on a Sonos group.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__play_album(args: {
  // The canonical album name
  album: string;
  // The canonical artist name, to disambiguate
  artist?: string;
  // The Sonos group ID
  group_id: string;
  // The music service to play from, when the user explicitly names one; omit otherwise.
  music_service?: "Amazon Music" | "Apple Music" | "Deezer" | "Pandora" | "Radio France" | "Sonos Radio" | "Spotify";
  // Set true only when the user clearly asks to shuffle; otherwise false (play in order). Sets the same state as set_shuffle_repeat_crossfade — no separate call needed.
  shuffle: boolean;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__play_artist

Play a mix of music from an artist on a Sonos group.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__play_artist(args: {
  // The canonical artist name
  artist: string;
  // The Sonos group ID
  group_id: string;
  // The music service to play from, when the user explicitly names one; omit otherwise.
  music_service?: "Amazon Music" | "Apple Music" | "Deezer" | "Pandora" | "Radio France" | "Sonos Radio" | "Spotify";
  // Set true only when the user clearly asks to shuffle; otherwise false (play in order). Sets the same state as set_shuffle_repeat_crossfade — no separate call needed.
  shuffle: boolean;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__play_player_line_in

Play the line-in audio from one Sonos player on a group. Use this when the user wants an external audio source (turntable, record player, CD player, etc.) connected to a player's line-in jack to play on a group — e.g., 'play the kitchen's line-in in the bedroom'. The source player must have a line-in jack — check that `LINE_IN` is in its capabilities from get_households_and_groups_and_players.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__play_player_line_in(args: {
  // The Sonos group ID
  group_id: string;
  // The player ID with the line-in jack (check `LINE_IN` in capabilities; from get_households_and_groups_and_players)
  source_player_id: string;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__play_playlist

Play a playlist from a music service on a Sonos group. For Sonos playlists, use play_sonos_playlist instead.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__play_playlist(args: {
  // The Sonos group ID
  group_id: string;
  // The music service to play from, when the user explicitly names one; omit otherwise.
  music_service?: "Amazon Music" | "Apple Music" | "Deezer" | "Pandora" | "Radio France" | "Sonos Radio" | "Spotify";
  // Set true only when the user is clear about an intent to play a personally-authored playlist on the music service: this matches personal playlists only. Otherwise, leave unset: matching is lenient and includes personal playlists alongside curated or branded ones.
  personal?: boolean;
  // The canonical playlist name
  playlist: string;
  // Set true only when the user clearly asks to shuffle; otherwise false (play in order). Sets the same state as set_shuffle_repeat_crossfade — no separate call needed.
  shuffle: boolean;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__play_radio

Play a live broadcast radio station on a Sonos group — a specific, named station the user tunes into, heard as a single continuous stream everyone gets in sync and can't skip. Covers over-the-air and internet broadcasts (BBC Radio 1, NPR, KEXP, 98.5 FM), streaming-native broadcast channels (Apple Music 1, Apple Music Hits), and hosted Sonos Radio shows ('Sunset Fuzz', 'Nashville Now'). Identify it by station or show name, call sign, or frequency — pass at least one of radio_name, call_sign, or frequency; add location only to disambiguate same-named stations. Use play_station instead for an endless station generated from a seed rather than identified by name.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__play_radio(args: {
  // The station's call sign (e.g. 'WBUR', 'KEXP')
  call_sign?: string;
  // The station's broadcast frequency (e.g. '98.5')
  frequency?: string;
  // The Sonos group ID
  group_id: string;
  // The station's location, to disambiguate same-named stations. Pass only when the user explicitly states one; never guess or infer it.
  location?: string;
  // The music service to play from. Defaults to Sonos Radio if omitted — it has the broadest catalog of broadcast stations and is the only place Sonos Radio's own signature shows exist. Set this only when the user explicitly names a different service, or you're confident the station or show is natively hosted there (e.g. 'Apple Music 1' on Apple Music).
  music_service?: "Amazon Music" | "Apple Music" | "Deezer" | "Pandora" | "Radio France" | "Sonos Radio" | "Spotify";
  // The canonical station or show name (e.g. 'BBC Radio 1', 'Apple Music 1', 'Sunset Fuzz')
  radio_name?: string;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__play_sonos_favorite

Play a Sonos favorite on a group. Use get_sonos_favorites first to find the favorite ID.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__play_sonos_favorite(args: {
  // The favorite ID (from get_sonos_favorites)
  favorite_id: string;
  // The Sonos group ID
  group_id: string;
  // Set true only when the user clearly asks to shuffle; otherwise false (play in order). Sets the same state as set_shuffle_repeat_crossfade — no separate call needed.
  shuffle: boolean;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__play_sonos_playlist

Play a Sonos playlist on a group. Use get_sonos_playlists first to find the playlist ID. For music service playlists use play_playlist instead.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__play_sonos_playlist(args: {
  // The Sonos group ID
  group_id: string;
  // The playlist ID (from get_sonos_playlists)
  playlist_id: string;
  // Set true only when the user clearly asks to shuffle; otherwise false (play in order). Sets the same state as set_shuffle_repeat_crossfade — no separate call needed.
  shuffle: boolean;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__play_station

Play a personalized, endless station generated from a seed on a Sonos group — something a music service turns into an algorithmic run of tracks (e.g. 'Daft Punk Radio', 'jazz station', 'a chill station', 'Bohemian Rhapsody radio'). Seed it with exactly one of station_name, artist, or track (whichever the user names). Use play_radio instead for a live broadcast station or a hosted Sonos Radio show ('Sunset Fuzz', 'Nashville Now') identified by name rather than generated from a seed.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__play_station(args: {
  // The artist name, when the station is seeded by a specific artist — e.g. pass 'Daft Punk' when the user says 'Daft Punk Radio'. Prefer this over station_name — it reaches native artist-radio features.
  artist?: string;
  // The Sonos group ID
  group_id: string;
  // The music service to play from, when the user explicitly names one; omit otherwise.
  music_service?: "Amazon Music" | "Apple Music" | "Deezer" | "Pandora" | "Radio France" | "Sonos Radio" | "Spotify";
  // The genre or mood seed for the station (e.g. 'jazz', 'a chill station'), when the station isn't seeded by a specific artist or track. Use artist or track instead when the user names one.
  station_name?: string;
  // The track name, when the station is seeded by a specific track — e.g. pass 'Bohemian Rhapsody' when the user says 'Bohemian Rhapsody Radio'. Prefer this over station_name — it reaches native track-radio features.
  track?: string;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__play_track

Play a track on a Sonos group.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__play_track(args: {
  // The canonical album name, to disambiguate
  album?: string;
  // The canonical artist name, to disambiguate
  artist?: string;
  // The Sonos group ID
  group_id: string;
  // The music service to play from, when the user explicitly names one; omit otherwise.
  music_service?: "Amazon Music" | "Apple Music" | "Deezer" | "Pandora" | "Radio France" | "Sonos Radio" | "Spotify";
  // The canonical track name
  track: string;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__remove_players_from_group

Remove players from a Sonos group. The removed players stop playing (their previous audio does not resume); the rest of the group continues uninterrupted. Use this for requests like 'remove the bedroom from the group' or 'ungroup the kitchen'. All players must belong to the same household as the group. IMPORTANT: After this call, always call get_households_and_groups_and_players once before continuing — group IDs and memberships from earlier in the conversation may be invalid (groups can be created, disbanded, or recomposed; player IDs stay stable). Don't reason about what changed; use the fresh state.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__remove_players_from_group(args: {
  // The Sonos group losing the players
  group_id: string;
  // The players to remove from the group
  player_ids: Array<string>;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__resume

Resume playback on a Sonos group — unpause and continue playing. This is the plain 'play'/'resume'/'unpause' action; to start new content, use one of the play_* tools. IMPORTANT: Stateless command — always execute when asked, without first checking or assuming whether music is playing or paused.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__resume(args: {
  // The Sonos group ID
  group_id: string;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__seek

Jump to a specific time in the currently playing track on a Sonos group. Pass position_millis for an absolute target, or delta_millis to fast forward (positive) or rewind (negative) from the current position.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__seek(args: {
  // Offset from the current position, in milliseconds — positive to fast forward, negative to rewind
  delta_millis?: number;
  // The Sonos group ID
  group_id: string;
  // Absolute time position within the track, in milliseconds
  position_millis?: number;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__set_group_mute

Mute or unmute all players in a Sonos group. Group volume and player volume are linked — changing one affects the other. To mute a single player, use set_player_mute instead.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__set_group_mute(args: {
  // The Sonos group ID
  group_id: string;
  // true to mute, false to unmute
  muted: boolean;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__set_group_volume

Set the volume of a Sonos group to a specific level. Scales all players in the group proportionally, preserving their relative balance — it does not set every player to the same level. If the group is muted (all its players muted), setting the group volume also unmutes it. Group volume and player volume are linked — changing one affects the other. To set the volume of a single player, use set_player_volume; to set every player to an identical level, call it on each player individually instead.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__set_group_volume(args: {
  // The Sonos group ID
  group_id: string;
  // Volume level
  volume: number;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__set_night_sound_and_speech_enhancement

Set Night Sound and Speech Enhancement for a Sonos player. Speech Enhancement improves TV dialogue and voice clarity; Night Sound reduces loud effects for late-night listening. Only supported on players with home theater playback (soundbars) — check that `HT_PLAYBACK` is in their capabilities from get_households_and_groups_and_players. Omit any setting to leave it unchanged; specify at least one.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__set_night_sound_and_speech_enhancement(args: {
  // Enable or disable Night Sound (reduces loud sounds, amplifies soft ones)
  night_sound?: boolean;
  // The Sonos player ID
  player_id: string;
  // Enable or disable Speech Enhancement (boosts speech clarity)
  speech_enhancement?: boolean;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__set_player_mute

Mute or unmute a Sonos player. Group volume and player volume are linked — changing one affects the other. To mute all players in a group, use set_group_mute instead.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__set_player_mute(args: {
  // true to mute, false to unmute
  muted: boolean;
  // The Sonos player ID
  player_id: string;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__set_player_volume

Set the volume of a Sonos player to a specific level. Setting a player's volume does not change its mute state. Group volume and player volume are linked — changing one affects the other. To set the volume of a whole group proportionally, use set_group_volume instead.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__set_player_volume(args: {
  // The Sonos player ID
  player_id: string;
  // Volume level
  volume: number;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__set_shuffle_repeat_crossfade

Change one or more of the shuffle, repeat, and crossfade settings for the content currently playing on a Sonos group: shuffle, repeat, repeat_one, or crossfade. Omit any setting to leave it unchanged; specify at least one. Settings take effect from the next track transition and do not change the currently-playing track. To shuffle content you are about to start, set the shuffle parameter on the play_* tool instead.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__set_shuffle_repeat_crossfade(args: {
  // Enable or disable crossfade
  crossfade?: boolean;
  // The Sonos group ID
  group_id: string;
  // Enable or disable repeating all tracks
  repeat?: boolean;
  // Enable or disable repeating the current track
  repeat_one?: boolean;
  // Enable or disable shuffle
  shuffle?: boolean;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__skip_to_next_track

Skip to the next track on a Sonos group. Use this when the user asks to skip or play the next track.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__skip_to_next_track(args: {
  // The Sonos group ID
  group_id: string;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```

## mcp__sonos__skip_to_previous_track

Skip to the previous track on a Sonos group. Use this when the user asks to go back or play the previous track.

exec tool declaration:
```ts
declare const tools: { mcp__sonos__skip_to_previous_track(args: {
  // The Sonos group ID
  group_id: string;
}): Promise<CallToolResult>; };
```
